# üëã Hi, I'm Aswathama Shanmugam Marimuthu

I'm a data scientist blending machine learning, scientific modeling, and full-stack deployment to solve real-world problems. From optimizing liver tumor ablation workflows to deploying facial recognition apps, I focus on building models that don‚Äôt just work they matter.
